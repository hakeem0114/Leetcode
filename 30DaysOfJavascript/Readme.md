# 30Days of Javascript (DONE)

https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/

- Prep for interviews
- Helped me correct wrong explanations of how I thought some methods worked eventhough I used them.
- Learned how implement multiple higher order functions & methods with primitive & none-primitive data types
- Worked on more complex recursive algorithms
- Learned that that I have been using memoization/caching without knowing, setTime limit, deboucing, throttling..

```
Leetcode used contructor components instead of ES6 class syntax I learned javascript with so this is good practice in case I need to update legacy code
```
